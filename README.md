# How to setup

```
docker-compose --file deployments/docker-compose.yaml up
```

Then go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

---

# How to edit settings

They are three files to add your own configuration to the project:

* The [deployments/docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/pcorbel/techline/blob/master/deployments/docker-compose.yaml) to configure docker
* The [configs/config.yaml](https://github.com/pcorbel/techline/blob/master/configs/config.yaml) to change server/DB settings
* The [configs/themes.yaml](https://github.com/pcorbel/techline/blob/master/configs/themes.yaml) to add your own predefined themes which will be available from the WebUI

Exemple:
```
  - title: "Other" # Your title
    color: "#0F9D58" # Your color in hexa format
    icon: "fas fa-star" # Your icon code from Font Awesome 5
```
